                <h2>Detached:This word never existed in my dictionary</h2>
                <p style="background-color: beige;">
                    Most of my friends have died . I didn't even show the courtesy to send  an invitation for the funeral of our friendship , I just removed them from my social media accounts . I did this because I thought that it will make me look strong and a girl who doesn't care but actually I do care I think about every person who left me or walked past me and also all those people who I left or blocked from my life . I think a lot about whether it's my mistake or theirs . The question isn't about who is right or who is wrong it's about how easily we make any connection and how easily or quickly we break it . It's strange and yet so compellingly familiar . So many of those we spent much of our time with once upon a time are totally out of the picture today. Feels like all those memories are from different lifetime , all the time when we used to laugh childishly on some non-sense things or share our deep and dark secrets unfiltered with each other . All that and much more is gone; they are nowhere to be seen . Along with the memories . persons have disappeared too . For lack of context and contact , we aren't there for each other. 

                    In other words, we are dead for each other.
                <h2>An year older </h2>    
                <p style="background-color: beige;">
                    Once upon a time,  we all agreed that we were going to grow up and become wiser . Turns out wisdom is not a guarantee. It's an unexpected end result . As you grow older, you become acutely aware of your strengths , but more importantly you come to terms with your weaknesses. Your resistance to rubbish and toxic increment in your life leads to decrease your circle. More and more in your life filter out , leaving you with precious few to ration your time and more importantly your energy . As , I wasted soo much of my energy and time with people who aren't there with me now . The thing I hate about myself is being connected with a person soo much that I loose myself . 

                    As we grow older (hopefully wiser) , we come face-to-face with reality that most of the memories we could recollect about some things that felt very special at that time , that place we thought is most fun , those people we thought are the best ...immediately aren't close to us , and it gets frustrating to accept these new tides of time. It's a solemn phase where names and faces both seem to blur out 
                    
                    One of the greatest pieces of wisdom is learning to accurately balance your time and energy . If we manage to survive all the inequities , all the foreboding , all the crappy shit then congratulations you are ON THE VERGE OF GETTING WISDOM !

                <h2>Chirpiness turned into Gloominess.</h2>
                <p style="background-color: beige;">
                    I used to be known for my chirpiness. A girl who can't stay quiet and has to fill all the pregnant pauses and awkward silence with some words because silence makes her deeply uncomfortable. But it looks like we change a bit with time and place, many situations change you entirely. Two or three years back if someone would have told me that there is a lot worse to face ahead, I might not have believed that person but here I am experiencing every situation and every kind of heartbreak. Now I am settled with the fact that there is only you who is there for yourself forever. After facing the real world you adopt a personality that isn't "The real you" (for the world) but that's what makes you feel comfortable and at peace.

                    Few years back , we lived in our own world that felt very promising and happening and we thought this the real world . Everything was new and Vibrant. Whatever we assumed to be correct, and wherever we were it all changed with time . This is the pull of time and the arc of life, but we all grow through it.
                    
                    But we are living in the generation where nobody has patience(including me) to learn things on their own. We want cheat code in everything we are part of. Amazing attitude bestowed on this generation by the bounty of modernity. When you are falling in love , you are bound to have second thoughts. That's human nature. When you are screwing up at your job , you are supposed to step back, not throttle and stretch ahead. When life is not going the way you planned , it's better to content yourself for a bit and then move ahead . You don't have to measure your vessel every time(like Itachi).
                    
                    Anyhow, if we were to step back into our past days and page through our innocent days, we'll notice that we were indeed happy. So what's the point of attaining maturity and understanding of this world if we aren't happy with what we have? It's all because of our change of perception about people and things around us . We don't reach out to people around us for our solutions now because everyone is in seek of solutions of their own problems although we all remain concerned and caring for each other. Most of our conversations are silent because they happen inside our skull. Small surprise we show up in each other's dreams uninvited . "Do you know I dreamt about you today?".
